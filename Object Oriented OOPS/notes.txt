Javascript Classes 
-------------------
- object is a collection of properties and methods
- properties :- variable name etc etc 
- methods means functions.

Parts Of OOPS: 
-------------
- constructor function 
- prototypes
- Instances (new, this)

const user = {
    username : 'deepak',
    fullname : 'deepak kumar nayak',
    email : 'deepak@gmail.com',

    getUsername : function(){
        conole.log(this.username)
    }
}

prototype
---------
- prototype is present only in function.
- proto and prototype both are diffrent things.
- prototype is an object and empty object which we get because of function 
- we can also use that empty object.
- proto is a reference


function hello(){
    console.log('hello')
}

hello.prototype.abc = "abc"
hello.prototype.name = function(){
    console.log('name')
}
