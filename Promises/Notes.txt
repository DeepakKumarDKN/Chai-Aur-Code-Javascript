Promises are used to handle asynchronous operation.

Promises consist of 3 Stages. 
    1. Pending.
    2. fulfill/resolve => when promises get fulfilled.
    3. reject


    promise is created using a new keyword with a executor function.

    const obj1 = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
        
    })
