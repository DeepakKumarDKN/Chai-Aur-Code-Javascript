if we are declaring something using var keyword then its scope is defined as funcion scoped
if we are declaring something using let and const then its scope is defined as blocked scope.

no need of using var its better to use let and const. 


VAR => : 
-----------
var name = "deepak"
name ="deepak kumar nayak"
console.log(name)

Output 
deepak kumar nayak

with the help of var we can update it as well as we cav redclare it 

var fulname = "deepak"
var fulname = "deepak kumar"

console.log(fulname)

so here i am re-declaring it with var

LET => : 
---------

let courseName = "javascript"
courseName = "chai are code"
console.log(courseName)

so let also allows us to updare it but it will never all us to re declare it just like var.
in case of let ot will give is a syntax error: 
SyntaxError: Identifier 'isLogin' has already been declared
let isLogin = true;
let isLogin = true

const
------
If we want to define something throught out the program which value we dont want to change then 
we can use const for that. 

const will never allow us to re-declare it and will also never allow us to updare it.
