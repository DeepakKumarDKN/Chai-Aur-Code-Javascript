Why functions are said to be first class Citizens.? 
    - supoose we have a function and if we can treat that function as a
        variable than that functions are said to be first class citizens. 
        storing it on a variable. 
    
    1. yes in javascript we can assign a funtion to a variable. lets get into an example: 
    
    -Example:

        const getuserName = function(){
            console.log('username')
        }

        getuserName()

    2. passing function as an argument to the functions, and when we pass a function as an argument to another function 
        we call them as call back function.

    - Example:

        const myName = function(){
            return "hello"
        }

        const getuserName = function(name, firstname){
            console.log(name(),firstname)
        }

        getuserName(myName, 'Deepak')
    
    3. One funtion can return another function

    - Example:

    function display(){
    return function userName(){
        console.log('username')
        }
    }
    display()()
